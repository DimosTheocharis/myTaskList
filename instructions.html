        <p>The "Task List" is a tool that helps you organize your goals and your tasks throughout the day.</p>

                <li>Click this button to save the changes you made in a saved Day. Be careful! You can only save changes commited in

        <h2>Saving Tasks</h2>
        <div class="savingTasks">
            <p>There are 2 ways to save your Tasks. The "Save Day" and the "Save Routine" buttons that will be displayed when you Click
                "Save the Day" button.
            </p>
            <ul class="savingMethods">
                <li>"Save Day":  This method will help you maintain the tasks exactly as they are the moment you save. For example, if you have
                    3 uncompleted goals and 2 completed, after you save them, there will be 3 uncompleted and 2 completed. This method is usefull if 
                    the tasks represent a specific and unique day.
                </li>
                <li>"Save Routine": This method will help you keep the tasks at solid frequently-used days that seem like routines.
                    For example, you may save every task and goal you have to do on Sundays, and every Sunday use this Routine to help
                    you organize your day.
